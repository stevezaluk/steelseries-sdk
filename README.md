# steelseries-sdk
A broken SDK and toolchain that lets you interact with the steelseries REST API

# Update
Im pretty sure steelseries removed the REST API from there software. I havent looked too far into this tho, I could be wrong and the tool could just be broken.

# Also, Unfinished
Not completely unfinished there are somethings in here that work (or used to work)
